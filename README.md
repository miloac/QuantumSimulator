# Complex Number Calculator
## Juan Camilo Mantilla
This Java Library implements the complex number calculator to make simulations on complex numer experiments, such as:

* Multi Slit Experiment
* Marble Experiment

To run the simulations you only need to clone or download the repository and import the QuantumSimulator class onto your program, you can invoke the static methods for their use.
The library runs on base Java so it doesn't require any other components.
